This is a Vehicle Parking ticket database coded by Phillip Mai as a University Project at UCSD. It is entirely coded in C. 
It takes vehicle parking tickets as input and organizes them in a database. It is able to search for specific vehicles or individual parking tickets, and uses hashmaps to speed up search runtimes. 
It also can print out the entire database or chains of vehicles for an overall view. It was tested on data from the NYC 2019 parking ticket database made up of 200,000 vehicles.
